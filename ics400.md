# Lab 400 - Adding Additional Policies

---

## Objectives

- Using API Platform Cloud Service to view Analytics of API's

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

## Introduction

In this Lab youâ€™ll view five of the charts available to API Managers.

## 1.1: Header Validation

### **1.1.1**: Adding the Header Validation

---

-Head back to your dashboard to view the home screen.



-Under the Available Policies tab you will see the `Interface Management` Section. Now click to expand the `Header Validation` Section.

### **1.1.2**: Applying Reject Header Validation

---

-After clicking the **Edit** in the previous step, the following prompt should show up for you.

![](images/400/image011.png)

-In the drop down select the `Reject` and `Any`. Also in the lower sections fill in the field with `policyreject`, `!=` in the dropdown, and `helloworldreject`. You may use any name you wish for the fields, just be sure to remember them.

### **1.1.3**: Testing the Reject Header Validation

---

-Navigate back to the Postman Application.

-As we have done in the previous sections, we will be appending the Headers in our request.

-Now we will be adding a key with the value of `policyreject` and a value of `anyotherheader` and then send the request.

![](images/400/image010.png)

-You will notice that it will give you a "400 Bad Request" error in the bottom right section of your screen. This is due to our settings in the previous section. Since the `policyreject` key does not have a value of `helloworldreject`, the response will be rejected.



-Now we will change the value of the key from `helloworldreject` to `helloworldreject` and send the request again.

![](images/400/image009.png)

-The response is now "200" again. This is because we have set our policy to reject any that isn't `helloworldreject` and now our responses are passing the rule.


### **1.1.4**: Applying Pass Header Validation

---
-Navigate back to the dashboard as you have done in previous steps.

-Now click the **Edit** in the `Header Validation` Request as we have done in the previous steps, the following prompt should show up for you.

![](images/400/image011.png)
