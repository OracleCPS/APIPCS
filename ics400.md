# Lab 400 - API Platform Cloud Service

---

## Objectives

- Using API Platform Cloud Service to view Analytics of API's 

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

## Introduction

In this Lab you’ll view five of the charts available to API Managers.

## 1.1: API Analytics

### **1.1.1**: API Analytics General Page

---

-To view analytics for your API:

-Back in the Management Portal (https://oc-129-150-76-122.compute.oraclecloud.com/apiplatform/public/login.jsp) click the `Analytics` tab for your API. The Analytics tab is the last on the left.

-The `General` page displays the Request Volume, Response Time, Payload Size, and Requests by Resource charts. The other charts are displayed on the Applications and Errors and Rejections tabs.

-The time controls on this page allow you to retrieve data for a specific period of time. By default, data from today (from 12:00AM to the current time) appears. Click `Last 24 Hours` to display data for a period 24 hours previous to the current time. If you want to display data for a different period, you can:

-select a pre-defined time period (current hour or week, specific month or year, last minute, hour, etc.) from the `Other` list, or
-click the time interval below the `Other` list to manually specify a start time, an end time, and a date.

-To return data for a specific gateway, enter the name(s) of the gateways to which the API is deployed. Analytics data is aggregated for all of the selected gateways; removing a gateway from this field also removes the data from the Analytics tab. You can further filter data by application. In the `Applications` field, you can enter the name(s) of applications registered to this API to display data for only these applications. Requests from unregistered applications are also collected; you can view data for all of these requests by selecting `Unknown Applications` from this list.

-Changes to any of these filters (time, gateway, or application) affects all of the data on the Analytics tab.

### **1.1.2**: Request Volume Chart

---

-The request volume chart displays how many requests an API deployed to a gateway received. For a given time, you can configure the chart to display all requests, only successful requests, only rejected requests, or only errored requests.

-The request volume chart provides a general overview of the traffic an API is receiving, how the requests are trending over time, and the overall health of the traffic in terms of rejected requests and other errors.

### **1.1.3**: Response Time Chart

---

-The response time chart displays, in milliseconds, the range of round-trip request and response times for a selected API. The ranges, represented by a gray bar, indicate the shortest and longest response times during the indicated time period. The median round-trip time is indicated by a blue bar in the range for a time period. For a given time, you can configure the charts to display the range of round-trip calls, the range of time spent in the API layer, and the range of time spent in the service layer.

-The response time chart gives API Managers an idea of the ranges and medians of response times for requests, how these trend over time, and how response times are split between the API and service layers.

### **1.1.4**: Payload Size Chart

---

-The Payload Size chart displays the size of the payloads sent with each request. You can filter this chart to display the size of request or response payloads.

![](images/400/image004.png)

-You didn’t send any requests with response payloads; click `Response` to view the size of response payloads sent from the backend services.

### **1.1.5**: Requests by Resource Chart

---

-The Requests by Resource chart, at the bottom of the General page, displays the number and distribution of requests to your service’s resources. For each resource, this chart displays:

- The total number of requests to each resource
- The percentage (of total requests) of requests to each resource
- The total number of policy rejections for requests to each resource
- The percentage (of total rejections) of rejected requests to each resource
- The total number of service errors for requests to each resource
- The percentage (of total errors) of errored requests to each resource

![](images/400/image005.png)

### **1.1.6**: Requests by Application Chart

---

-Click the `Applications` page to view the Requests by Application chart.

![](images/400/image009.png)

-The Requests by Application chart displays the number and distribution of requests from each application, identified by the app key passed with each request. This chart displays two entries: one for the application you created in the lab, and another for the Customer Mobile App you registered to your API. For each resource, this chart displays:

- The total number of requests from each application
- The percentage (of total requests) of requests from each application
- The total number of policy rejections for requests from each application
- The percentage (of total rejections) of rejected requests from each application
- The total number of service errors for requests from each application
- The percentage (of total errors) of errored requests from each application

![](images/400/image010.png)

-You should not have received any errors; these columns in the table should be blank. If you sent requests from other applications, an entry for each application also appears here.

### **1.1.7**: Rejection Rate Chart

---

-Click the `Errors and Rejections` page to view the Rejection Rate chart.

![](images/400/image011.png)

-The Rejection Rate chart displays the number of requests to your API rejected by policy conditions.

![](images/400/image012.png)

-You can filter this chart to display all rejections, rejections from policies in the request flow, rejections from policies in the response flow, and rejections from the backend service. You can also filter the chart to display only rejections from specific policy types. Select `Header Validation` from the `Select a policy` list. This displays only rejections by the header validation policy.

### **1.1.8**: Rejection Distribution Chart

---

- The Rejection Distribution chart displays the number and distribution of rejections of your requests. 

![](images/400/image013.png)

-You can filter this chart to display all rejections, rejections from policies in the request flow, rejections from policies in the response flow, and rejections from the backend service. Select `Show Policy Types` to show the number of rejections for each policy type; select `Show Policy Instances` to show rejections from each instance of a policy. For example, if you have multiple header validation policies, selecting Show Policy Types displays all header validation policy rejections as a single data point. If you select Show Policy Instances, rejections from each of the header validation policies are displayed as separate data points.

### **1.1.9**: Other Analytics Charts

---

-These charts are also available in API Platform Cloud Service:

- Error Rate: Displays number of occurrences and percent of total errors over time, per API. You can filter this chart to display all errors, policy errors, service errors, or a specific error. API and Gateway Managers can use this to see how many errors have occurred and the ratio of errored requests to total request volume.
- Error Distribution: Displays the number of occurrences and percent of total errors, per API. You can filter this chart to display all errors, policy errors, or service errors. API and Gateway Managers can use this to see the frequency at which each error occurs

### **1.1.10**: Gateway Analytics

---

-In Oracle APIPCS, you can view Gateway Analytics Charts. In the current release of APIPCS, they are the same as those available on the API Analytics tab. The difference is that the data displayed on the Gateway Analytics tab represents all APIs deployed to a gateway (unless you apply filters); the data displayed on the API Analytics tab represents only the selected API.

-To view analytics for all APIs deployed to a gateway:

-Click the `Gateways` tab.

![](images/400/image014.png)

-Select API `Gateway` available from the list.

![](images/400/image015.png)

-Click the `Analytics` icon.

![](images/400/image016.png)

-Oracle APIPCS will display a summary of the API calls processed by the Gateway.
