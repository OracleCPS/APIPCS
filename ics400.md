# Lab 400 - Adding Additional Policies

---

## Objectives

- Using API Platform Cloud Service to view Analytics of API's

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

## Introduction

In this Lab youâ€™ll view five of the charts available to API Managers.

## 1.1: Header Validation

### **1.1.1**: Adding the Header Validation

---

-Head back to your dashboard to view the home screen.



-Under the Available Policies tab you will see the `Interface Management` Section. Now click to expand the `Header Validation` Section.

-Now click the **Apply** button when you select the `Header Validation` Section

![](images/400/image002.png)


-You will now see the `Header Validation` policy in the Requests section of the API Implementation. Click the **Edit** button to bring up the menu.

### **1.1.2**: Applying Reject Header Validation

---

-After clicking the **Edit** in the previous step, the following prompt should show up for you.

![](images/400/image011.png)

-In the drop down select the `Reject` and `Any`. Also in the lower sections fill in the field with `policyreject`, `!=` in the dropdown, and `helloworldreject`. You may use any name you wish for the fields, just be sure to remember them.

### **1.1.3**: Testing the Reject Header Validation

---

-Navigate back to the Postman Application.

-As we have done in the previous sections, we will be appending the Headers in our request.

-Now we will be adding a key with the value of `policyreject` and a value of `anyotherheader` and then send the request.

![](images/400/image010.png)

-You will notice that it will give you a "400 Bad Request" error in the bottom right section of your screen. This is due to our settings in the previous section. Since the `policyreject` key does not have a value of `helloworldreject`, the response will be rejected.



-Now we will change the value of the key from `helloworldreject` to `helloworldreject` and send the request again.

![](images/400/image009.png)

-The response is now "200" again. This is because we have set our policy to reject any that isn't `helloworldreject` and now our responses are passing the rule.


### **1.1.4**: Applying Pass Header Validation

---
-Navigate back to the dashboard as you have done in previous steps.

-Now click the **Edit** in the `Header Validation` Request as we have done in the previous steps, the following prompt should show up for you.

![](images/400/image011.png)

-In the drop down select the `Pass` and `Any`. Also in the lower sections fill in the field with `policypass`, `=` in the dropdown, and `helloworldpass`. You may use any name you wish for the fields, just be sure to remember them.

![](images/400/image006.png)

### **1.1.5**: Testing the Reject Header Validation

---

-Navigate back to the Postman Application.

-As we have done in the previous sections, we will be appending the Headers in our request.

-Now we will be adding a key with the value of `policypass` and a value of `anyotherheader` and then send the request.

![](images/400/image008.png)

-You will notice that it will give you a "400 Bad Request" error in the bottom right section of your screen. This is due to our settings in the previous section. Since the `policyreject` key does not have a value of `helloworldpass`, the response will be rejected.



-Now we will change the value of the key from `anyotherheader` to `helloworldpass` and send the request again.

![](images/400/image007.png)

-The response is now "200" again. This is because we have set our policy to reject any that isn't `anyotherheader` and now our responses are passing the rule.

## 1.2: Interface Filtering

### **1.2.1**: Adding the Interface Filtering

---

-Head back to your dashboard to view the home screen.



-Under the Available Policies tab you will see the `Interface Management` Section. Now click to expand the `Interface Management` Section.

![](images/400/image001.png)

-Now click the **Apply** button when you select the `Interface Filtering` Section

![](images/400/image012.png)


-You will now see the `Interface Filtering` policy in the Requests section of the API Implementation. Click the **Edit** button to bring up the menu.

![](images/400/image013.png)


### **1.1.2**: Applying the Interface Filtering

---

-After selecting Interface filtering and clicking the **Edit**, the following prompt should show up for you.

![](images/400/image014.png)

-In the drop down select the `Reject` and `ALL` from the Methods Dropdown. In the resources enter `/hello/world`, to use for this example.

![](images/400/image015.png)

-Once this has been completed, save the changes and then redeploy the API again.


### **1.1.3**: Testing the the Interface Filtering

---

-Navigate back to the Postman Application.

![](images/400/image010.png)

-This time we will be appending the POST address. It should be similar to `https://oc-129-144-150-133.compute.oraclecloud.com:9022/helloworlduser01/hello/world`. The same POST address that we have been using previously, with the `/hello/world` that we created in the previous step.

![](images/400/image016.png)



-If the previous steps were done correctly it should show a status of `405 Method Not Allowed`, rather than 200 or 404 Error. This is a result of the interface filtering rejecting the resource you have set. Now if you remove the `/hello/world` from the end of URL, the response should be a 200 again.
